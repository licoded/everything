I want to use this to auto start clash when restart my ubuntu machine.

It is just half successful.

- [x] write a auto shell script
- [ ] auto run this shell script after restart
    - TODO: maybe it have been executed, I don't test it
    - because I also see that the tmux need some time to start after restart
        - but I try execute tmux command very soon after restart, it just behave OK
